## Hi there 👋

- 👨🏻‍💻 work: currently as postdoc at Justus-Liebig-University Giessen (Germany)

I am a trained political scientist with a strong background and focus on quantitative analysis and methods. Before completing my doctorate at the University of Giessen, I studied at the Universities of Cologne and Vienna. In the last years, I had two international research visits: Universidade Federal de Pernambuco in Recife, Brazil (6 months) and Universidad de Carlos III in Madrid, Spain (2 weeks). I demonstrated my interpersonal and cultural skills in these research stays and at international conferences/workshops. These experiences in (international) teams have sharpened my ability to operate and contribute effectively in diverse environments. Throughout projects (research and teaching), I have strengthened my ability to conceptualize, plan, and execute projects. I am currently employed in the EU-funded project [G-EPIC: Gender Empowerment through Politics In Classrooms](https://g-epic.eu) until September 2024.

## 🔍 What I Bring to the Table:

- Expertise in Quantitative Data Analysis: Extensive experience in handling and interpreting (large) datasets.
- Project Management: Proven ability to conceptualize, plan, and execute complex research and teaching projects.
- Global Perspective: International exposure and experience, adding a diverse outlook to my skill set.
